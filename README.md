# Text Editor in C

This is a lab exercise for the Procedural Programming Course of the 2nd semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras. It was created in May 2020.

The editor can read text given in a .txt file format and help its writer correct any misspellings, by comparing the textâ€™s words to a predefined vocabulary. The corrected version is then saved in a new file.
It can also generate statistics for the text and save them in another file.

The vocabulary used is stored in the "englishWords.txt" file. The files "alice.txt" and "alice_small.txt" can be used as an input for the text editor.
